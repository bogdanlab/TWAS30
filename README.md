American Journal of Human Genetics. 2017 Feb. [doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.01.031](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(17)30032-0)

Each `*.txt` file contains the TWAS results for a particular trait. Each file is prefixed with a header naming the 12 columns.
A description of each of these columns is provided below,

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| TRAIT | GWAS trait |
| GENE | Gene or transcript used to test for association with GWAS trait |
| CHR | Chromosome the gene is located on |
| TxS | Transcription start site |
| TxE | Transcription end site |
| STUDY | The original panel expression levels were measured in |
| TWAS.Z | TWAS association statistic |
| TWAS.P | TWAS association p-value |
| BEST.GWAS.RSID | RSID of the best GWAS SNP within 1 Mb of the gene TxS (i.e. smallest p-value) |
| BEST.GWAS.P | P-value of the best GWAS SNP |
| GWAS.HSQ.LOCAL | Local heritability estimate of GWAS trait |
| ALPHA | Standardized effect of gene/transcript expression on trait |

We use the following shorthand notation for the 30 complex traits,

| Shortname | Trait |
